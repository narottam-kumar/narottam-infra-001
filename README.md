# üôè Tribute App ‚Äì Flask Web Assignment

This is a heartfelt web application developed using **Python Flask** to pay tribute to Ashish Sir and Aman Sir for their guidance, mentorship, and incredible support.

Unlike our previous assignments involving `HTML` and `Nginx`, this task involves building and running a **Flask-based Python web app** locally and on a **Linux VM hosted in Azure**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup Instructions

### ‚úÖ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/narottam-kumar/narottam-infra-001.git
cd narottam-infra-001
````

---

## üß™ Run the App Locally on Windows

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python (if not installed)

Download and install Python from:
üîó [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Ensure Python and pip are added to the system PATH.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Flask

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

```bash
pip install flask
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Flask App

```bash
python Tribute.py
```

The app will start running at:
üìç `http://localhost:5000`
Open this URL in your browser to view the tribute.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to Azure Linux VM

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Linux VM on Azure

* Use Ubuntu.
* Allow **port 5000** in Network Security Group (NSG) during creation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ SSH into Your VM

```bash
ssh <your-username>@<your-vm-public-ip>
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python, pip, Flask on VM

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
pip3 install flask
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Transfer the Flask App to the VM

From your local machine, use `scp`:

```bash
scp Tribute.py <your-username>@<your-vm-public-ip>:~/
```

Or to copy the whole repo:

```bash
scp -r ./narottam-infra-001 <your-username>@<your-vm-public-ip>:~/
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Flask App on the VM

```bash
python3 Tribute.py
```

The app will be available at:
üìç `http://<your-vm-public-ip>:5000`

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Access from Browser

Open the URL in your browser using the public IP of the VM.

---

## üê≥ Docker ‚Äì Containerize and Run the Tribute App

This section guides you through containerizing the Flask app using Docker, running it locally, and deploying it on your Azure Linux VM.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Docker

* **Windows:**
  Download Docker Desktop from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and install.

* **Azure Linux VM:**
  SSH into your VM and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

*Optional:* Add your user to the docker group to run docker without `sudo`:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Dockerfile

In your project directory (`narottam-infra-001`), create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install Flask
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir flask

# Expose port 5000 for the Flask app
EXPOSE 5000

# Set environment variable for Flask app
ENV FLASK_APP=Tribute.py

# Run the Flask app
CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=5000"]
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Docker Image (Locally)

In your terminal or PowerShell, inside your project folder, run:

```bash
docker build -t tribute-app .
```

This will build the Docker image and tag it as `tribute-app`.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Docker Container (Locally)

Run the container and map port 5000 of the container to port 5000 on your local machine:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 tribute-app
```

Now open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

You should see the tribute app running inside the Docker container.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Push Docker Image to Docker Hub (Optional)

If you want to run the app via Docker on Azure VM without transferring files, push your image to Docker Hub:

* Log in to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker login
```

* Tag your image with your Docker Hub username:

```bash
docker tag tribute-app yourdockerhubusername/tribute-app:latest
```

* Push the image:

```bash
docker push yourdockerhubusername/tribute-app:latest
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Run Docker Container on Azure Linux VM

#### Option A: Pull from Docker Hub

On your Azure VM, pull the image:

```bash
docker pull yourdockerhubusername/tribute-app:latest
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 yourdockerhubusername/tribute-app:latest
```

#### Option B: Build Directly on VM

Transfer your project files (including the Dockerfile) to your VM using `scp`:

```bash
scp -r ./narottam-infra-001 <your-username>@<your-vm-public-ip>:~/
```

SSH into VM and build:

```bash
cd narottam-infra-001
docker build -t tribute-app .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 tribute-app
```

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Access the App on Azure VM

Open a browser and navigate to:

```
http://<your-vm-public-ip>:5000
```

You should see the tribute app running inside Docker on your Azure VM.

---

## ‚úÖ Notes

* Make sure port `5000` is open in both:

  * Azure NSG (firewall)
  * Local VM firewall (`sudo ufw allow 5000` if UFW is enabled)
* To stop the Docker container, use:

```bash
docker ps
docker stop <container_id>
```

* To keep the container running after logout, consider running it with `-d` (detached mode) as shown above.

---

## üì¶ Files in This Project

* `Tribute.py` ‚Äì Main Python Flask app.
* `Dockerfile` ‚Äì Docker configuration for containerizing the app.
* `README.md` ‚Äì Step-by-step guide.
* HTML embedded inside the Python file using `render_template_string`.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Dedication

This app is a tribute with love and gratitude to
**Ashish Sir** & **Aman Sir** ‚Äî our mentors, guides, and true inspirations. üôè
